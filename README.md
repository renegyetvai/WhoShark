# WhoShark
A small World of Warcraft addon to capture playernames around through the click of a macro.

## Usage
Clone the repository to the addon folder of your local WoW installation e.g. ```C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Battle.net\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\```. Then activate the addon inside the game after launching. To finally use the addon efficiently create a macro for reloading the ui since the "Who" subsystem got bound to a user interaction by Blizzard to write into the Saved_Variables file.
